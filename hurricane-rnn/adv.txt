HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND...TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE OVER PORTIONS OF
THE NORTHEAST GULF COAST THROUGH MONDAY.
 
STORM SURGE...THE COMBINATION OF A STORM SURGE AND THE TIDE WILL
CAUSE NORMALLY DRY AREAS NEAR THE COAST TO BE FLOODED BY RISING

THE TIMES OF HIGH TIDE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS...
 
APALACHEE BAY TO WACCASASSA BAY...4 TO 6 FT
FLORIDA WEST COAST SOUTH OF WACCASASSA BAY...2 TO 4 FT
COASTAL ALABAMA EASTWARD TO APALACHEE BAY...2 TO 4 FT
SOUTHEASTERN LOUISIANA TO COASTAL MISSISSIPPI...1 TO 3 FT
 
THE DEEPEST WATER WILL OCCUR ALONG THE IMMEDIATE COAST IN AREAS OF
ONSHORE FLOW.  SURGE-RELATED FLOODING DEPENDS ON THE RELATIVE
TIMING OF THE SURGE AND THE TIDAL CYCLE...AND CAN VARY GREATLY OVER
SHORT DISTANCES. FOR INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO YOUR AREA...PLEASE

WET SOIL CONDITIONS...THESE ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS WILL EXACERBATE THE
FLASH FLOOD THREAT ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHERN FLORIDA AND SOUTHERN
ALABAMA.
 
TOTAL RAIN ACCUMULATIONS OF 2 TO 4 INCHES ARE EXPECTED OVER COASTAL
ALABAMA...MISSISSIPPI...LOUISIANA AND SOUTH FLORIDA...WITH ISOLATED
MAXIMUM AMOUNTS OF 6 INCHES POSSIBLE.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND...TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE OVER PORTIONS OF
THE NORTHEAST GULF COAST THROUGH TODAY.
 
STORM SURGE...THE COMBINATION OF A STORM SURGE AND THE TIDE WILL
CAUSE NORMALLY DRY AREAS NEAR THE COAST TO BE FLOODED BY RISING

ALABAMA-FLORDA BORDER EASTWARD TO APALACHEE BAY...2 TO 4 FT
SOUTHEASTERN LOUISIANA TO ALABAMA-FLORIDA BORDER...1 TO 3 FT
 
THE DEEPEST WATER WILL OCCUR ALONG THE IMMEDIATE COAST IN AREAS OF
ONSHORE FLOW.  SURGE-RELATED FLOODING DEPENDS ON THE RELATIVE
TIMING OF THE SURGE AND THE TIDAL CYCLE...AND CAN VARY GREATLY OVER
SHORT DISTANCES. FOR INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO YOUR AREA...PLEASE

10 TO 15 INCHES OVER EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE AND
NORTHERN FLORIDA...WITH ISOLATED MAXIMUM AMOUNTS OF 25 INCHES
POSSIBLE.  SURROUNDING THIS AREA...TOTAL RAIN ACCUMULATIONS OF 5 TO
10 INCHES ARE EXPECTED OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA AND SOUTHEAST GEORGIA
INTO COASTAL SOUTH CAROLINA...WITH ISOLATED MAXIMUM AMOUNTS OF 15
INCHES POSSIBLE.  GIVEN THE RECENT HEAVY RAINFALL AND WET SOIL
CONDITIONS...THESE ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS WILL EXACERBATE THE FLASH
FLOOD THREAT ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHERN FLORIDA AND SOUTHERN
ALABAMA.
 
TORNADOES...A FEW TORNADOES ARE POSSIBLE TODAY ACROSS THE EASTERN
FLORIDA PANHANDLE...AND WESTERN AND CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE FLORIDA

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Edisto Beach South Carolina to South of South Santee River

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 24-36 hours.

Interests elsewhere in eastern North Carolina should monitor the
progress of Ana.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Subtropical Storm Ana was
located near latitude 32.1 North, longitude 77.4 West.  The storm is
moving toward the north near 2 mph (4 km/h).  A turn toward the
northwest and then back to the north at a slightly faster forward
speed is expected over the next 48 hours.  On the forecast track,
the center will be near the coasts of South and North Carolina by
Sunday morning.

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate tha maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph
(95 km/h) with higher gusts.  Little additional strengthening is
forecast through Saturday morning.  A gradual weakening trend is
likely to begin within 24 hours.

Winds of 40 mph extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from the
center.

The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter
aircraft data is 998 mb (29.47 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area, and possible within the watch area, by Saturday
afternoon or evening.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters.
The water could reach 1 to 2 ft above ground at times of high tide
in coastal areas from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina southward
through South Carolina. For information specific to your area,
please see products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Ana is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 2 to
4 inches, with isolated amounts of 6 inches, over eastern portions
of North Carolina and South Carolina through the weekend.

SURF:  Swells generated by Ana are affecting portions of the
southeastern U.S. coast.  These swells will likely cause life-
threatening surf and rip currents.  Please see statements issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach portions of the
Central Bahamas by Thursday morning.  Winds are expected to first
reach tropical storm strength in the warning area tonight, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to
protect life and property should be rushed to completion.  Tropical
storm conditions are possible in the southeastern Bahamas beginning
tonight.  Hurricane conditions could reach the northwestern Bahamas
early on Friday.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels in areas of
onshore flow. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and dangerous waves.

RAINFALL:  Joaquin is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain
over much of the central Bahamas, with isolated maximum amounts of
20 inches possible over San Salvador and Rum Cay through Friday
night. Rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches are possible over the
southeastern Bahamas through Friday night, with 2 to 4 inches
expected over the northwestern Bahamas.

SURF:  Swells generated by Joaquin will affect portions of the
Bahamas during the next few days, and will begin to affect portions
of the southeastern coast of the United States by Thursday. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area, and are possible within the watch area, by this afternoon or
evening.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters.
The water could reach 1 to 2 ft above ground at times of high tide
in coastal areas from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina southward
through South Carolina.  For information specific to your area,
please see products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Ana is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 1 to
3 inches, with isolated amounts of 5 inches, over eastern portions
of North Carolina and South Carolina through Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Ana are affecting portions of the
southeastern U.S. coast.  These swells will likely cause life-
threatening surf and rip currents.  Please see statements issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The Tropical Storm Warning has been discontinued for Florida Bay
and the Florida Keys.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Northwestern Bahamas, including the Abacos, Andros Island, Berry
Islands, Bimini, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama Island, and New Providence
* Boca Raton to South Santee River
* Lake Okeechobee

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...

* North of South Santee River to Surf City

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Englewood to Anclote River

Interests elsewhere in the Florida Peninsula and in the Carolinas
should monitor the progress of Matthew.

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-
force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.  Preparations to protect life and property should be
rushed to completion.

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside
the United States, please monitor products issued by your national
meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Matthew was
located by NOAA Doppler weather radars and an Air Force Reserve
reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 27.1 North, longitude 79.2
West. Matthew is moving toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).
A turn toward the north-northwest is expected on Friday, and a turn
toward the north expected Friday night or Saturday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Matthew will be moving near or over the east
coast of the Florida peninsula through Friday night, and near or
over the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Matthew is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  A gradual weakening is forecast during the
next 48 hours.  However, Matthew is expected to be a category 3 or
stronger hurricane as it moves near the coast of Florida.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).

The latest minimum central pressure reported by the reconnaissance
aircraft was 939 mb (27.73 inches). An automated station on the west
end of Grand Bahama Island recently reported a pressure of 943.1 mb
(27.85 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions should diminish over portions of the
northwestern Bahamas tonight.

Hurricane conditions are expected to first reach the hurricane
warning area in Florida during the next several hours and will
spread northward within the warning area through Friday.  Tropical
storm conditions will continue to spread northward in the warning
area along the Florida east coast tonight and Friday.

Hurricane conditions are expected to spread northward in the warning
area in Georgia and South Carolina Friday night and Saturday with
tropical storm conditions expected on Friday.

Winds increase rapidly in elevation in a tropical cyclone.
Residents in high-rise buildings should be aware that the winds at
the top of a 30-story building will be, on average, about one
Saffir-Simpson category higher than the winds near the surface.

Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning
area in the Carolinas on Friday night and Saturday.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and large
and destructive waves could raise water levels by as much as the
following amounts above normal tide levels...

Northwestern Bahamas...10 to 15 feet

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Sebastian Inlet, Florida, to Edisto Beach, South Carolina, including
portions of the St. Johns River...7 to 11 ft
Edisto Beach to South Santee River, South Carolina...4 to 6 ft
Boca Raton to Sebastian Inlet, Florida...4 to 6 ft
South Santee River, South Carolina, to Cape Fear, North Carolina...2
to 4 ft
Virginia Key to Boca Raton, Florida...1 to 3 ft

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.
Large waves generated by Matthew will cause water rises to occur
well in advance of and well away from the track of the center.

The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline.  There is a danger of life-
threatening inundation during the next 36 hours along the Florida
east coast, the Georgia coast, and the South Carolina coast from
Boca Raton, Florida, to South Santee River, South Carolina.
There is the possibility of life-threatening inundation during the
next 48 hours from north of South Santee River, South Carolina, to
Cape Fear, North Carolina. For a depiction of areas at risk, please
see the Prototype National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning
Graphic. For information specific to your area, please see products
issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.

The Prototype Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic is a depiction of
areas that would qualify for inclusion under a storm surge watch or
warning currently under development by the National Weather Service
and planned for operational use in 2017.  The Prototype Graphic is
available at hurricanes.gov.

RAINFALL:  Matthew is expected to produce total rainfall amounts in
the following areas:

The northern Bahamas...8 to 12 inches, isolated 15 inches
The Atlantic coast of the United States from Central Florida to
eastern North Carolina...6 to 12 inches with isolated totals near
15 inches along the coasts

TORNADOES:  An isolated tornado or two is possible along the
east-central Florida coast tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew will continue to affect portions
of the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas during the next few days,
and will spread northward along the east coast of Florida and the
southeast U.S. coast through the weekend.  These swells will likely
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Hermine was located near latitude 37.2 North, longitude 69.6 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near
10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn toward the north with a decrease in
forward speed is expected later today, followed by a slow
north-northwestward motion through Monday.  On the forecast track,
the center of Hermine will meander slowly offshore of the
mid-Atlantic coast for the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Hermine is expected to be at or near hurricane
strength during the next 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.

The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force reconnaissance
aircraft observations is 999 mb (29.50 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will spread northward within the
warning area along the Atlantic coast through Monday.  Tropical
storm conditions are possible in the watch area by Monday.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  Along the immediate
coastline, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.  There is a danger of life-threatening inundation within the
next 36 hours from Cape Charles, Virginia, to Sandy Hook, New
Jersey.  Persons within these areas should take all necessary
actions to protect life and property from rising water.  Promptly
follow all instructions, including evacuation orders, from local
officials.  There is also the possibility of life-threatening
inundation during the next 48 hours at many coastal locations
between Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and Bridgeport, Connecticut,
including Long Island.

For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype Storm
Surge Watch/Warning graphic, which displays areas that would qualify
for inclusion under a storm surge watch or warning currently under
development by the National Weather Service and planned for
operational use in 2017.  The Prototype Graphic is available at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

North Carolina sounds and northern Outer Banks...1 to 2 feet
Cape Charles to Chincoteague, VA...2 to 4 feet
Chincoteague, VA to Atlantic City, NJ...3 to 5 feet
Atlantic City to Sandy Hook, NJ...2 to 4 feet
Sandy Hook, NJ to Bridgeport, CT including Long Island...1 to 3
feet

RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall associated with Hermine will remain
offshore through Monday/Labor Day.  Hermine will produce rainfall
amounts of 1 to 2 inches over southern New England from Long Island
to eastern Massachusetts, and additional rainfall of one inch or
less along the coastline of the mid-Atlantic states.

SURF:  Large waves generated by Hermine will affect the U.S. east
coast from the mid-Atlantic states and expand northward along the
coast of southern New England through Monday.  These waves are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,
and significant beach erosion.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Matthew was located
in the Gulf of Gonave near latitude 18.9 North, longitude 74.3 West.
Matthew is moving toward the north near 10 mph (17 km/h). On this
track the eye of Matthew will move over the Windward Passage and
eastern Cuba today.  A turn toward the north-northwest is expected
by Wednesday, followed by a northwest turn Wednesday night. Matthew
is expected to move near or over portions of the southeastern and
central Bahamas tonight and Wednesday, and approach the northwestern
Bahamas Wednesday night.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 145 mph (230 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Matthew is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-
Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are
possible during the next couple of days, but Matthew is expected to
remain a powerful hurricane through at least Wednesday night.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 950 mb (28.06 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are already affecting the southwestern
portion of Haiti, and these conditions will spread northward today.
Hurricane conditions are expected to reach eastern Cuba later today,
the southeastern Bahamas Tuesday evening, the central Bahamas on
Wednesday, and the northwestern Bahamas Wednesday night.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected to continue spreading across the
remainder of Haiti today, eastern Cuba later this morning, the
southeastern Bahamas later today, and the central and northwestern
Bahamas Tuesday night and Wednesday, making outside preparations
difficult or dangerous.

Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions the Dominican
Republic within the warning area today, and will spread northward
into the Turks and Caicos Islands tonight.

Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch areas in
Cuba tonight with tropical storm conditions possible later today.

Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch
area in Florida by late Thursday, with tropical storm conditions
possible by early Thursday. Tropical storm condition are also
possible in the Florida tropical storm watch area by early Thursday.

RAINFALL:  Matthew is expected to produce total rainfall amounts in
the following areas:

Southern Haiti and southwestern Dominican Republic...15 to 25
inches, isolated 40 inches
Eastern Cuba and northwestern Haiti...8 to 12 inches, isolated
20 inches
Eastern Jamaica...4 to 6 inches, isolated 10 inches
The Bahamas...8 to 12 inches, isolated 15 inches
Turks and Caicos Islands...2 to 5 inches, isolated 8 inches
Northeastern Haiti and the Northern Dominican Republic...1 to 3
inches, isolated 5 inches
Western Jamaica...1 to 2 inches, isolated 3 inches
Upper Florida Keys northward to coastal east-central Florida....4 to
7 inches, isolated 10 inches
Middle to Lower Florida Keys....1 to 3 inches, isolated 5 inches

Life-threatening flash floods and mudslides are likely from this
rainfall in southern and northwestern Haiti, the southwestern
Dominican Republic, and eastern Cuba.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and large
and destructive waves could raise water levels by as much as the
following amounts above normal tide levels...

Southern Coast of Cuba east of Cabo Cruz...7 to 11 feet
South Coast of Haiti...7 to 10 feet
Northern Coast of Cuba east of Camaguey...4 to 6 feet
Jamaica...2 to 4 feet
Gulf of Gonave in Haiti...3 to 5 feet
Southern coast of the Dominican Republic...1 to 3 feet
The Bahamas...10 to 15 feet

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.
Large waves generated by Matthew will cause water rises to occur
well in advance of and well away from the track of the center.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew will continue to affect portions
of the coasts of Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the
Caribbean coastline of Central America during the next few
days.  Swells from Matthew will begin affecting portions of the
Bahamas on Tuesday.  These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
